<!-- This project was made by in collaboration the members of `BENNY` group. Initially we were thinking to use  `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript`, and `Python`, but unfortunately while we were using Pyhton and trying to connect it with the HTML, It was very very tough for us. So because of the above reason we only use `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript`. And we want you to know that our project lack a lot of work we , the member of the group, are grade 12 students and we were very busy with models and assignments so we didn't give the project pur time work on it. it's version 1 so we'll try to do a very great job on the upcoming versions. -->

This project was a collaborative effort by the members of the `BENNY` group. Initially, our plan was to utilize `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript`, and `Python`. However, we encountered significant difficulties when attempting to integrate `Python` with `HTML`. As a result, we proceeded with using only `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Javascript`.

>We would like to emphasize that our project is still a work in progress and lacks substantial development. As grade 12 students, we faced time constraints due to our commitments to exams and assignments. This is version 1 of our project, and we fully intend to dedicate more time and effort to future versions, striving to deliver a significantly improved result.
