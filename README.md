## Our Group Name Origin
The group name "`BENNY` represents the initials of our members name: Biruk, Ezra, Nathan, Napi, and Yetemgeta. We also include Sandros in the acronym by using the letter "S" in `stationery.` This symbolizes our unity, acknowledges every member, and reflects our shared goals and individual contributions. Our group identity is a testament to our strong bond and collective strength.

## About the project

<br/>
<img src="img/img/template.png" href="https://github.com/yetemgeta/Benny._.stationery"><br/><br/><br/>

This project was a collaborative effort by the members of the `BENNY` group. Initially, our plan was to utilize `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript`, and `Python`. However, we encountered significant difficulties when attempting to integrate `Python` with `HTML`. As a result, we proceeded with using only `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Javascript`.

>We would like to emphasize that our project is still a work in progress and lacks substantial development. As grade 12 students, we faced time constraints due to our commitments to exams and assignments. This is version 1 of our project, and we fully intend to dedicate more time and effort to future versions, striving to deliver a significantly improved result.
