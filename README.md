## Our Group Name Origin
The group name "`BENNY` represents the initials of our members' names: Biruk, Ezra, Nathan, Napi, and Yetemgeta. We also include Sandros in the acronym by using the letter "S" in `stationery.` This symbolizes our unity, acknowledges every member, and reflects our shared goals and individual contributions. Our group identity is a testament to our strong bond and collective strength.

## About the project

<br/>
<img src="Benny._.stationery/BENNY._.STATIONERY/img/img/template.png" href="https://github.com/yetemgeta/Benny._.stationery"><br/><br/><br/>

This project was a collaborative effort by the members of the `BENNY` group. Initially, we planned to utilize `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript`, and `Python`. However, we encountered significant difficulties when attempting to integrate `Python` with `HTML`. As a result, we proceeded with using only `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Javascript`.

>We would like to emphasize that our project is still a work in progress and lacks substantial development. As grade 12 students, we faced time constraints due to our commitments to exams and assignments. This is version 1 of our project, and we fully intend to dedicate more time and effort to future versions, striving to deliver a significantly improved result.

  ## Pages

  Unfortunately, the current state of the website only offers a single page, the `404.html` file. This means that users may encounter difficulties accessing the content they are seeking. However, Me and my team want to assure you that we are actively working on expanding the website's offerings in future updates. 

  ### 404.html

This page currently serves as a temporary placeholder on our website. Its purpose is to act as a link or redirection point to other essential pages, such as the "About" page, the "Contact" page, and more. We understand that encountering a 404 error can be frustrating for users, as it typically indicates that the requested page is not found.

   <img align="" width="" src="Benny._.stationery\BENNY._.STATIONERY\img\README\404.png" alt="404" />

   ### Back.html

By entering the required information in the "register" section, you can easily access this page and experience its valuable features. Once you have completed the registration process, you will be automatically redirected to the "back.html" page, granting you seamless access to its contents and functionalities.

  <img align="" width="" src="Benny._.stationery\BENNY._.STATIONERY\img\README\back.png" alt="back" />

This page boasts a plethora of diverse and valuable elements, and we have exciting plans to incorporate additional features in the future. Let's delve into the contents of this page, starting with the prominent header section. At the top, you will find an elegant header displaying a captivating quote, along with the various pages and a distinctive logo that represents our brand.

In the image, you'll notice a striking arrow with the text "open." This visual cue invites users to discover more by revealing the side panel. Simply clicking or tapping the arrow triggers the graceful unfolding of the side panel, unveiling a plethora of additional functionalities and options.

Below the side panel arrow, you'll find the navigation menu, which is also available on the home page. However, the main focus of the page is the table — an inventory management system created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We have plans to incorporate Python to further enhance its features.

In the image provided, you'll notice a search box positioned at the top of the table. This feature enables users to search for and access specific items within the table. The main interface of the table consists of five columns. The first column lists the items, while the second column displays their corresponding values. The third column represents the quantity of each item, and in the fourth column, you can find the total amount. The total amount is calculated by multiplying the quantity of an item by its value. The last column, known as the action column, allows users to delete specific items from the table.

Beneath the table, you'll find 4 buttons: "Add row," "Save," "Export," and "Choose file." The "Add row" button enables users to add a new row for an item, expanding the table as needed. The "Save" button serves as a saving the table and calculating the total value based on the provided information. The "Export" button allows users to save the table as a CSV file, facilitating data sharing and backup. Lastly, the "Choose file" button enables users to import a CSV file into the table or workspace, providing a convenient way to import existing data.

These buttons and functionalities contribute to the overall usability and versatility of the inventory management system, making it easier for users to add, edit, save, and export data effortlessly.

### side panel 

<div> 
    <div style="float: left; width: 50%;"> 
      <div align="left"> On the side panel, users have access to three helpful tools: a calendar, a note-taking feature, and a calculator. These tools aim to enhance productivity and provide convenient utilities for users while they work.

The calendar allows users to keep track of important dates, appointments, and events. It provides a visual representation of dates and can be customized to display daily, weekly, or monthly views. Users can add, edit, and delete events, set reminders, and efficiently manage their schedules.

The note-taking feature enables users to jot down ideas, make to-do lists, or capture important information. It provides a digital space for users to create and organize their notes. Users can easily create new notes, edit existing ones, and categorize them for easy reference. This feature helps users stay organized and ensures important information is readily accessible.

The calculator tool provides a convenient way for users to perform calculations without the need for a separate application. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is user-friendly and provides a simple interface for quick and efficient calculations.
